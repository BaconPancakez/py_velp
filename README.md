## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) (Python package manager)
- A [Yelp API Key](https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs/fusion-authentication) (for accessing the Yelp API)

### Setup

- Clone this repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/BaconPancakez/py_velp
  cd py_velp
  ```

- Create and activate a virtual environment:

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- Install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

  ```bash
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Add your Yelp API Key in a `config.py` file:

  Create a `config.py` file in the root directory of the project with the following content:

  ```python
  # config.py
  api_key = 'YOUR_YELP_API_KEY'
  ```

  Replace `'YOUR_YELP_API_KEY'` with your actual Yelp API Key.

## Configuration

The `config.py` file contains sensitive configurations like your API key. Ensure this file is listed in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data.
